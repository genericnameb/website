            <h3>Get ready for a wall of text</h3>
            <p>I've never been good at introducing myself but here it goes.</p>
            <p>I'm an developer (in training) based in the Greater Vancouver Area.  I graduated from Mcgill University with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.  I worked in the industrial construction industry post graduation until layoffs due to the global pandemic.  In my time off I decided to pick up programming and some time later here we are.</p>
            <p>All pictures on this website were taken by my dad and I have shamelessly stolen them.  So photocredit: Dad</p>
            <p>In my offtime I enjoy playing video games and making things with my hands - primarily woodworking/metalworking.  My logic is that I like nice things, but I don't like paying the associated price.  With that said see a bunch of my work below and how I made mistakes on every single one.  We shall go in reverse chronological order because I'd like to think that I got better as time progressed, so if you get bored halfway then at least you started with the nicer stuff.  Side note is that my dad has helped on almost every (woodworking) job, so when I say "I", I really mean my dad and I</p>

            </div>
            <p>My most ambitions project to date, and the one I messed up the most - my dresser.</p>
            <p>I feel like everything that could go wrong did go wrong on this project.  I started by making the frame with some 1" x 1" x 1/8" HSS that I had when I placed a bulk order a while back.   Cut the pieces to length and welded them together.  Welded the tabs near the corners so I could fasten the wooden panels</p>
            <p>I bought wood from Reimer's Hardwood in Abbotsford.  They had a special bin of red oak that was milled to about 3/4" thickness.  For those who don't know, typically when you buy lumber it is rough, there may be warp, twist, etc.  You would buy at thicker than finished product, and spend some time planing and squaring the lumber.  When I saw the special bin that said it was squared already, I thought that it'd be perfect - I wouldn't have to spend time making the planks all square saving the time and effort.  Spoiler alert - they didn't do a very good job.</p>
            <p>I cut the wood to appropriate length and glued them into planks to form the sides as well as the front panels.  To start with, 3 to 4 planks at a time were glued together, and then those pieces glued to eaach other (can't easily apply glue to so many pieces and join them). Two days after starting the glue up (takes time to dry), I picked up the first panel and it fell apart it in my hands.  Chalking it up to a bad job at glue up, and being overly ambitions and trying to glue too many pieces together, I cleaned up the edges of the pieces that didn't hold, as well as split apart flimsy pieces and tried again.  Another couple of days pass and this time it held together, but was very flimsy - if I pushed hard enough it would definitely snap.</p>
            <p>I came up with the idea to fasten the boards to another piece of wood (you can see the vertical pieces in the picture with a missing drawer front), but then you can see the ugly screws from the side.  My dad mentioned that he had a plug maker and a special drill to accomodate the plug.  We modified all the long panels and they were finished - time to "dry-fit" them onto the metal frame.</p>
            <p>When you buy steel, you would expect them to be straight right?  Turns out they weren't.  When I was welding them together, the overall dimensions were fine near the weld joints - so it was 60" wide near the top and bottom, but at the middle the steel is a bit bowed, and is slightly less than 60".  Thus the rectangular panels didn't fit, and took a bit of cutting here and there (and a hammer) to fit them into place.</p>
            <p>Now  that the panels were done (I thought) it was time to make the individual dressers (for now without the front oak panel).  I got some plywood with a nice veneer from RONA and cut the pieces to size and glued the pieces together.  I fastened the drawer slides (which were $20 each x 5) to both the panels and the drawers.  Then it was the moment of truth - if I measured accurately then it the drawers would slide on perfectly.  The  good news is that most of them slid on just fine.  One of them wouldn't go in and another two were not sliding perfectly.</p>
            <p>After measuring and troubleshooting for a while, it turns out that the slightly not straight steel and the slightly uneven wood meant that the drawer slides weren't all the same distance apart and weren't all parallel.  Since the dressers were made all the same width it meant that some didn't fit.  The inelegant but effective solution was to put washers in between the drawer slides and the vertical pine planks.  Some slides required two washers in the front to compensate for my lack of skill.</p>
            <p>Now that all the dressers were sliding as perfectly as my patience allowed, I glued the front panels on.  I'm not sure how I messed it up so badly but each piece had to be remeasured and cut.  They were all slightly under 12" but that was not enough clearance.  With that out of the way it was time to create a method to open the drawers.</p>
            <p>My initial idea was to cut out a slot at the top of each drawer so that you can pull them out.  Super minimalist and stylish.  I cut out the template on a piece of plywood to use as a guide and was going to use a router.  I clamped the template to the back of the top piece and start to use the router.  It was going fine for all of 20 seconds, cutting away at the oak until I noticed it didn't look right.  Turns out the clamps didn't hold out very well and I ended up cutting too deeply, and I can't exactly uncut it.  Ctrl-Z doesn't work in real life.  I had to cut out the piece of oak with the mistake, and glue in a new piece and cut it to size.</p>
            <p>Since the router method didn't work, and I didn't have enough oak pieces remaining to afford to make those mistakes again, I made a trip to Rona and bought drawer pulls and installed them.  Project completed!! The drawers don't line up perfectly in the front, some stick out a bit too much - a combination of non-flat boards, not straight steel, and a straight up lack of skill.  This can be fixed by adjusting drawer slides but is good enough for now.</p>
            <p>I brought the piece inside, and when I measured the place where I initially wanted to put it, it would fit and seemed fine in my mind.  When actually finished and put in location, it was unsuitable because I built this thing way too big.  I don't have that many clothes I'm not sure what I was thinking but I'm happy with it.</p>
            <p>Two months later I noticed that one of the drawers wasn't sliding properly.  Due to the temperature difference indoors and outdoors (my projects are all built outside) the wood had shrunk and a 1/8" crack formed along a glue seam on the side.  The shrinking of the wood also caused both side panels to warp inwards.  I didn't know what to do and my dad came up with the simple solution of installing a beam inside to prop the panels to proper width.  This has worked but next summer I'll probably have to take it outside, readjust the drawer slides so the panels line up, fix up the crack, and maybe apply another wood finish</p>
            <h3>The bed</h3>
            <div class="bed-container container">
                <img src="./bed_pieces.jpg" alt="Bed panels" class="vertical-pic">
                <img src="./bed_assembled.jpg" alt="Bed in situ" class="horizontal-pic">
                <img src="./bed_final.jpg" alt="What the bed looks like in the end" class='horizontal-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>The bed wasn't that hard a project.  Didn't stop me from messing it up though.  It came about because I wanted to upgrade from a twin bed to a queen size bed, and by now I had all the tools so I thought "hey why not".</p>
            <p>I started by welding the frame together and welding tabs to fasten the planks to.  If you've noticed my design asthetic by now its probably because 90° angles are way easier than other angles.  The welding portion was fine, so now onto the woodworking portion.</p>
            <p>I used pine planks because I was being cheap, and stained the top and bottom piece dark brown to make it look fancy.  From a distance it looks nice but the stain didn't apply evently.  Apparently there's a thing called wood sealer which I didn't know existed, helps to even out the stain and you have to apply it before you apply the stain.  Oh well.  The planks were in place and ready to go.</p>
            <p>Since the frame and the panels were to heavy to move together, the frame was moved into my room first, and then the planks attached.  I had to use an angle grinder to cut the excess length of the carraige bolt.  I was slightly worried about the amount of sparks it created indoors but that's what a fire extinguisher is for.  I made a wooden support that went on the ground to help support the box spring.  I also modified the panel at the foot of the bed with hinges and a handle so I can store stuff under the bed.  All that was left was the new box spring and mattress.</p>
            <p>The delivery company brought the mattress and the box spring.  My dad and I moved the box spring in.  I asked the company what the dimensions were for their queen size prior to starting the build, and I made sure to make the dimensions of the bed frame slightly larger.  Turns out my tolerances were too tight, and the box spring almost didn't fit.  In an ideal scenario, if the box spring were lowered evenly (imagine a crane putting it in), it would fit perfectly.  Unfortunatley two sides of this bed are against the wall, so the box srping had to have one edge in diagonally and the opposite edge lowered.  There wasn't a lot of room to maneuver and the trusty hammer came into play again.  The box spring is in but I'm pretty sure its not coming back out in one piece if I ever want to move.  Also a latex bed is way heavier than you would think so that was also a pain.  Project completed!</p>
            <h3>The oh so ugly bike weld</h3>
            <div class="bike-container container">
                <img src="./bike_weld.jpg" alt="weld on bike" class='horizontal-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>My dad was complaining about the kick stand on his bike, it was slightly bent out of shape due to a crack so he wanted to fix it.  Since I had a welder, why not?</p>
            <p>I didn't measure the thickness of the bike stand.  I thought "how hard can it be", bent the kick stand back in place, fired up the welding machine, and proceeded to burn right through the metal.  Now instead of just welding a small crack, the kickstand was in two pieces.  Nice.</p>
            <p>In the end, with awkward clamps and awful welding, I put the kick stand together.  And it looks awful, but it works.  Like so awful if someone tried to pass that off as work they'd probably get fired.  Project completed..?</p>
            <h3>The welding cart/creeper</h3>
            <div class="welding-container container">
                <img src="./welding_cart.jpg" alt='Welding cart frame' class='horizontal-pic'>
                <img src='./welding_cart_final.jpg' alt='Welding cart final' class='horizontal-pic'>
                <img src='./welding_cart_and_creeper.jpg' alt='Welding cart and creeper' class='vertical-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>The welding cart and creeper weren't exciting projects.  I bought way too much steel so I decided why not - as is the basis for most of my decisions.  I wanted the welding cart because carrying the welder and the gas tank everywhere is incovenient, and my dad wanted to creeper to slide under a vehicle while working on it</p>
            <p>Surprisingly nothing too bad happened on this project.  I wanted to use a mesh cage to support the welder, but couldn't find one for a reasonable price, so used plywood and painted it with heat resistant paint.  The paint can apparently be used for barbeques, and the employee said that sparks should be fine, just no direct flames.  Whats the worst that can happen?  Project complete.</p>
            <h3>The desk</h3>
            <div class='desk-container container'>
                <img src='./desk.jpg' alt='walnut desk' class='vertical-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>The desk was my first project using nicer lumber, my desk at the time was too small and I didn't like the amount of legroom.  I started by going to Reimer's and buying walnut.  I made a 60" x 30" desk with 2" thick walnut and the wood alone cost me $600.  I do not have a truck so I bought a roof rack for my sedan, and got some funny looks as I loaded the walnut on the top of my car and drove home.</p>
            <p>The metal working portion is all very similar box structures.  I was talking to a friend (Matt I if you ever read this I'm talking about you) who mentioned that I could leave my welds in place, it would add a nice aesthetic.  He probably was picturing his nice welds done with skill.  Most of my welds looked pretty bad, so all my joints are ground flat.  So far none of my furniture have split apart but we shall see.</p>
            <p>The walnut was a pain to mill to size, since walnut is a rather "hard" wood, the planer wasn't could only remove a bit per pass.  All the planks were planed to an even thickness and glued together.  The planks all seemed to be consistent width, but after glue up one side  measures 32" wide and the other measures 32.75" wide</p>
            <p>One thing I never mentioned on the other projects is how much sannding and finishing there is.  There were so many hours spend sanding the wood. So. Many. Hours. The finish that I am using requires drying time, and multiple layers need to be applied.  Things take time yo.</p>
            <p>At the time of making the desk, I didn't have a good way to fix the discrepancy in width.  I now have a track saw which I might use to fix it later one.  In the picture the desk top is very clearly not centered, but that's only because the desk top isn't fastened down, it doesn't look like that now.  I am extremely pleased at how the walnut turned out, it makes me content each time I take a look at it and since I spend 80% of my time at home by my computer I'm a pretty content individual.  Project finished.</p>
            <h3>The door</h3>
            <div class='door-container container'>
                    <img src='./door_before.jpg' alt='door before' class='vertical-pic'>
                    <img src='./door_final.jpg' alt='door after' class='vertical-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>I wanted to practice glue ups of large planks before I made my desk, reason being that walnut is expensive, but pine is cheap.  I decided to make my ddoor out of wood planks, and the door with uniform color is my first attempt.</p>
            <p>I mismeasured the door, but it wasn't a big deal because the door still just barely wide enough to close properly, so the door went up and that was all she wrote.  Until it wasn't.</p>
            <p>In the summer when the door went up everything was fine.  In the winter the door shrunk, and now it wouldn't close and there was a gap between the door and the door gap.  The second picture was a modification I had to make so that the door would close properly.  I cut out a section and glued in a new plank that was stained brown for a nice contrast.  The new door was now slightly so it requires a bit of force to close in the summer.  Now that the weather has cooled it works perfectly.  Project complete.</p>
            <h3>The shelf</h3>
            <div class='shelf-container container'>
                <img src='./shelf_metal.jpg' alt='Shelf metal frame' class='vertical-pic'>
                <img src='./shelf_final.jpg' alt='Final shelf' class='vertical-pic'>
            </div>
            <p>This shelf was the first project.  This occured right after all bought all my tools and although it looks fine and works, it isn't perfectly square.  A large number of my welds on this thing didn't work, there was not enough penetration and they could just be snapped off.  The steel I bought was hot rolled, and there is mill scale on it.  I am way too lazy to grind off all the mill scale so I turned to google.  One person suggested using acid to treat the mill scale, so I did and then welded everything together.  I put black paint on afterwards but it started forming what looked like rust crystals.  I took the shelf back outside, ground off the parts that looked particularly bad and just applied the paint once more.  A friend of mine said that his company uses Rust-o-leum even on mill scale and it works fine so I've been doing that for all my other projects.</p>
            <p>If you look carefully, the individual shelves aren't perfectly level.  The shelf also tilted forward slightly so I put more felt pads on one side than the other. Project complete.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Take a look at my first attempts at MIG welding with my spiffy new Millermatic 141.  Can you guess which  weld is  reasonable and which is just awful?  I did no prep work and thought it would be as easy as pulling the trigger.  I was in fact very wrong and had to grind off the mill scale for the weld to look passable.  Of course the practice welds were easy in ideal positions, as mentioned previously bunch of my welds on my shelf project weren't good and the parts just snapped apart.  Practice complete</p>

            </div>
            <p>We originally had carpet in the basement of our house and decided to replace it with vinyl plnaks.  My younger self thought that puke orange would be a cool colour for my bedroom.  I started by painting the walls - it turns out that painting takes the least amount of time when painting a room.  Sanding takes so time.  After spending a couple hours sanding I decided it was good enough and painted it to a much more neutral gray.</p>
            <p>After pulling up all the carpet and underlayer, we noticed what appeared to be linoleum tile.  Most of the pieces came up easier but others were very firmly glued.  It proved very stubborn and the only method we found was heating and scraping a portion at a time.  For the pieces that did not come off easily we left as is.  In hindsight we should have poured a levelling concrete but at the time it didn't seem out of level.</p>
            <p>We cut and laid down vinyl planks, and some portions of the floor were not quite level so the planks didn't join together properly.  It still came together nicely and was an upgrade from the 20 year old carpet.  Project complete.</p>

            <p>And thats all I have in my project bucket, if you want to let me know what I did wrong, you can contact me via the navbar.  I hoped you enjoyed laughing at my mistakes, and look forward to seeing me update this on my woodworking journey.  The next project I have in mind is a small coffee table with the leftover piece of walnut from when I made my desk.</p>
